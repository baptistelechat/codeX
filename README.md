A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension for accessing documentation directly from the IDE.

## ✨ Features

The codeX extension allows the user to read dependency documentation in VSCode:

- Display official dependency websites if a package.json file is detected
- Display of dependency name, available documentation version and short description if available
- Opening documentation in an editor side panel
- Display of a markdown interpreter for documentation hosted on GitHub

Go to your activity bar to see all available websites. After installation, a new icon appears to access the extension!

## üîé Search a package

With codeX, you can effortlessly search for documentation for any package directly from Visual Studio Code.

Whether you're working with npm or packagist **(other popular package managers will be available soon).**

<u>Quick access :</u>
Open documentation in a side panel or directly in your default web browser with a single click.
<u>Automatic registry detection :</u>
CodeX intelligently detects the registry based on your query and directs you to the correct documentation source.
<u>Use keywords :</u>
You can filter results according to specific registries (npm or packagist for the moment).
